# Rust Snake Game

This is a simple snake game written in Rust. The idea of it, was that I didn't have any knowledge of
Rust language, and I wrote it using ChatGPT.

It was a programming challenge, and a way to start learning a new technology. Completely recommended.

## Setup

1. Clone repository.
2. To test it, run:
```
cargo run
```
3. If want to create a binary, run:
```
cargo build --release
```
